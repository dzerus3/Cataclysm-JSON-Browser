# Cataclysm JSON Browser

> A browser for common JSON info

This program has been created as an offline alternative for the [item browser](https://cdda-trunk.chezzo.com). Although the item browser is great, there are a few reasons why it might not be for you.

- You do not have access to the internet for extended periods of time
- You do not want to start up a browser just for this
- You prefer a text only interface for one reason or another
- You want information on something that is not an item (i.e. mutations)
- You want to see edits that are not part of the official release
- You want save the information for later use
- The item browser is handing out server errors instead of information
- And so on

---

## Currently implemented
- Basic text-based interface
- Abbreviations for text-based commands
- Looking for item information

---

## Planned features

- Graphical User Interface
- Overhaul of text-based interface
- Things in item browser: construction, vehicle parts
- Things not in item browser: mutations, bionics, martial arts
- Saving output in text format, for easy retrieval
- Proper configuration
