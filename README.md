# Cataclysm JSON Browser

> A browser for common JSON info

This program has been created as a sort of alternative for the online item browser. Although the item browser is great, there are a few reasons why it might not be for you.

- You do not have access to the internet for extended periods of time
- You do not want to start up a browser just for this
- You prefer a text only interface for one reason or another
- You want information on something that is not an item (i.e. mutations)
- You want to see edits that are not part of the official release
- You want save the information for later use
- The item browser is handing out server errors instead of information
- And so on

---

## Currently implemented
- Text-based interface
- Abbreviations for text-based commands
- Looking for item information

---

## Planned features
- Looking for crafting recipes, disassembly, etc.
- Graphical User Interface
- Things in item browser: construction, vehicle parts
- Things not in item browser: mutations, bionics, martial arts
- Saving output in text format, for easy retrieval
- Proper configuration

## Example
> To find the description for a rag:
`item description rag`

> To find recipes with a rag in it:
`i recipes rag`

> To find the effects of the fleet footed mutation:
`mutation fleet footed`
